1. [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson](https://pdfdrive.com.co/wp-content/pdfh/The-Subtle-Art-of-Not-Giving-a-Fck-PDFdrive.pdf)
2. Animal Farm - Novella by George Orwell
     - Animal Farm is a story about farm animals who refuse to obey their cruel human master and fight back for a better life. The story seems simple at first, but as it goes on, the plot gets more complicated, and each part is more interesting and compelling than the last. George Orwell's allegory-based book about a whole era shows how corruption, manipulation, political recession, fascism, and communism affected people's lives. Animal Farm is a great book with a powerful lesson that is still true 76 years after it was first published. It takes place in a world that seems carefree and magical during the Soviet era. There is always corruption and dictatorship on the horizon in the world, so this story is a must-read to teach people about the risks of being part of the common class. It is important for anyone who wants to help change the political world and fight for freedom. It is also a great read for anyone, from casual readers to historians, because it has a lot of historical importance. Overall, Animal Farm by George Orwell is a masterpiece with a great plot and a lesson that is still relevant today. Its author is without a question one of the best writers of the 20th century.
